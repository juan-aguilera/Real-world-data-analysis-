# **Data Analysis Project: Social and Economic Development**

## **Introduction**
This project aims to analyze social and economic development data using a real data source from the World Bank Open Data. Test Driven Development approach will be applied to ensure at least 90% coverage in unit tests. The analysis results will be presented at the end of this document, including three generated graphs. 

### **Data Source**
The World Bank Open Data database was used, providing free access to a wide variety of economic, social, and environmental indicators for countries worldwide.

## **Project Description**

### Data Acquisition: Relevant data was downloaded from the World Bank Open Data.
### Exploratory Data Analysis: An exploratory analysis of the data was conducted to understand its structure and characteristics.
### Test Development: Test Driven Development approach was applied to write unit tests covering at least 90% of the code.
### Data Analysis: The data was processed and analyzed to identify significant trends and patterns.
### Graph Generation: Three graphs were created to visualize the analysis results.
### Results Presentation: Analysis to share the findings and conclusions from the graphs.
